# nutexb_swizzle
Documentation and tools for Tegra X1 swizzling used for nutexb texture files for Smash Ultimate. See the [swizzle](swizzle.md) page for documentation. The swizzle code and bit pattern technique is based on the following [blog post](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-swizzling/). 

## Generating Test Data
1. Write unique block values to the Nutexb. Pad the image size with `--blockcount` as needed.  
`cargo run -- write_addresses -w 512 -h 512 -f bc7 -o "def_mario_001_col.nutexb" --blockcount 43872` 
2. Write the unique block values to a binary file. Pad the image size with `--blockcount` as needed.  
`cargo run -- write_addresses -w 512 -h 512 -f bc7 -o "/swizzle_data/linear.bin" --blockcount 43872`
3. Calculate the deswizzled version of `linear.bin` using an emulator or reference swizzle/deswizzle implementation. Save the resulting blocks to `deswizzle.bin`. The provided test data is generated by dumping the raw OpenGL texture data from the base mip level using [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) and [yuzu emulator](https://yuzu-emu.org/) (tested on version 500). The emulator deswizzles the texture data, which allows for computing a lookup table and guessing the swizzle patterns. 
4. For power of two textures, guess the swizzle pattern.
`cargo run -- calculate_swizzle -w 512 -h 512 -f bc7 --swizzled "linear.bin" --deswizzled "deswizzle.bin"`
